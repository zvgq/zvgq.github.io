## Are you bad enough to help rebuild ZVGQ?

ZVGQ is looking for help to finally get the site revamp we've all been waiting for off the ground!

If you are someone with experience with web development and/or design, we could use your help. Take a look at the list below for the skills we are actively looking for. If you think you can help, or if you think there is something missing from the list that you can contribute, ping us on Twitter [@zvgq](https://twitter.com/zvgq) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zanyvideogamequotes).

We have started mapping out our project timeline, but we are open to suggestions and recommendation on how to make this project a reality once and for all!

Get in on the ground level and lend a hand! More news to come soon.
